# Push this repo's unified plugin source tree to the box lab. The source project keeps its
# historical SmoothServer directory name for build compatibility, but emits the single
# SwmarlyValheimNetworking assembly.
#
# Because src/Directory.Build.props is the nearest such file to the .csproj, once synced it
# is what the lab's own ./build.sh actually builds against (MSBuild uses the nearest
# Directory.Build.props found walking up from the project, not a merge of every one found) —
# NOT the lab's separate top-level /opt/modlab/Directory.Build.props. That's deliberate: this
# repo's props file is self-sufficient (defaults to /game/... exactly like the lab's own file
# did, so the lab's build.sh needs no changes) and also works standalone via
# VALHEIM_MANAGED/VALHEIM_BEPINEX_CORE for a non-lab machine. See src/Directory.Build.props.
#
# Usage: scripts/sync-to-lab.sh [remote-host] [remote-path]
