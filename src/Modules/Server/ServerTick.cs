    /// could not be edited by the agent that wrote these modules. 0.3.0's Plugin.cs discovers every
    /// FeatureModule subclass in the assembly by reflection, Configure()s it against the one
    /// ConfigFile (so ConfigWatcher hot-reload covers it), TryEnable()s it against the running side
    /// and lists it in the single module summary line - so the second plugin GUID is gone. One
    /// [BepInPlugin] per DLL: a second one shows up as a phantom mod in r2modman and the BepInEx log.
